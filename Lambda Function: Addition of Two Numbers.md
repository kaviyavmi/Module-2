# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
f = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c
result = f(a, b, c)
print(result)
```

## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully
